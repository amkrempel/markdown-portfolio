I ❤️ podcats. Some of my favorites right now are:
- You're Wrong About
  - All of the episodes are great, but I just finished the Terri Shiavo episode and it was mindblowing. 
- Maintainance Phase
  - This podcast looks at weight loss and wellness, and covers a lot of scams.
- Swindled
  - More scams!
- Bad Batch
  - A series about a particular healthcare scam: stem cell treatments.
